## News

> (Oct 20, 2022) **Note to Nvidia users:** You may see a popup that your graphics driver is out of date. This is a warning that can be ignored. To remove this warning, disable `DXVK-NVAPI/DLSS` in your Lutris runner options.

> (Oct 17, 2022) DXVK v1.10.2/v1.10.3 may cause a black or transparent screen after launching the game depending on your hardware. If you experience this, try a different DXVK version.

> (Oct 14, 2022) Penguins on rolling release distributions (ie. Arch, Manjaro) are reporting sound issues in-game. The solution is to set `Prefer System Libraries` in Lutris to `ON`.

> (Jun 11, 2022) **Note to Nvidia users:** NVIDIA users Should use [gnusenpai DXVK v1.10.1 or later](https://github.com/gnusenpai/dxvk/releases) to fix the `corrupted size vs. prev_size` error. Can be installed manually or from the LUG helper.

> (March 6, 2022) **Note to Nvidia users:** Driver v495 causes issues for most people. If you have unresolvable performance issues with 510, try 470.

> (Feb 27, 2022) Glorious Eggroll runners are now based on Proton experimental instead of wine staging. The release version numbers no longer correspond to wine version numbers. The major version number reflects the Proton version it is based on. The numbers after the dashes only reflect GE releases/patches.

> (Feb 12, 2022) **Easy Anti-Cheat is live.** CIG is aware of the problem but there is still no ETA. There are currently no consequences that we are aware of for using the workaround, but CIG has said that eventually people will be kicked for tripping EAC. Ask in any of our social channels or use the LUG Helper.
