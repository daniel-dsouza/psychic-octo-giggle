## News

> (Dec 7 2021) **Easy Anti-Cheat is live.** CIG is aware of and working on the problem, but there is no ETA. There is a workaround, but we can't officially recommend it as it may get you kicked or, if CIG decides to, banned. If you really must know, ask on any of the social channels.

> (Dec 7 2021) **Failed to retrieve wine** During installation of Star Citizen, you may receive an error that Lutris failed to retrieve wine. We have submitted a request to the Lutris team to fix their install script, which is trying to download an invalid version of the GE runner. Until then, work around this issue by first installing the runner using the Helper. Then, navigate to the runner directory (~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine) and rename the directory wine-lutris-ge-6.21-1-x86_64 to the name that Lutris expects: lutris-ge-6.21-1-x86_64.

> (Nov 13 2021) We currently recommend the GloriousEggroll 6.19 runner. 6.20 does not work for everyone.

> (Nov 13 2021) Note to Nvidia users: Driver 495 may not work. Use 470 instead.
