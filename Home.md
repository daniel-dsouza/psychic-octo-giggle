## News

> (Dev 6 2021) **Easy Anti-Cheat is live.** CIG is aware of and working on the problem. For now, you can use [this special branch](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper/tree/eac-workaround) of the LUG-Helper to apply a workaround to /etc/hosts and delete the EAC files. This workaround will stop working when CIG decides to start kicking players who trigger the anticheat. We haven't heard anything about bans, but we don't know for sure what their plans are. It goes without saying, use this workaround at your own risk.

> (Nov 13 2021) We currently recommend the GloriousEggroll 6.19 runner. 6.20 does not work for everyone.

> (Nov 13 2021) Note to Nvidia users: Driver 495 may not work. Use 470 instead.
