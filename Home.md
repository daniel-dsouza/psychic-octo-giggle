## News

> (Dec 6 2021) **Easy Anti-Cheat is live.** CIG is aware of and working on the problem, but there is no ETA. There is a workaround, but we can't officially recommend it as it may get you kicked or, if CIG decides to, banned. If you really must know, ask on any of the social channels.

> (Nov 13 2021) We currently recommend the GloriousEggroll 6.19 runner. 6.20 does not work for everyone.

> (Nov 13 2021) Note to Nvidia users: Driver 495 may not work. Use 470 instead.
