## AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling
In the Lutris `Runner options` tab, enable `AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution` or set the environment variable `WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1`. Then, in the Star Citizen graphics settings, set the game to fullscreen and your desired resolution and it will be FSR scaled up. We recommend restarting the game after changing its resolution for better performance.

## Head tracking using Opentrack
At the moment, the simplest method to use Opentrack with Star Citizen is to install the Windows version of Opentrack within Lutris
- Configure it to run from the same wine prefix as Star Citizen
- Select "Freetrack 2.0 enhanced" as the output

## Automatically Disable/Re-Enable Mouse Acceleration
Lutris can automatically toggle on/off a flat mouse acceleration profile with the following configuration

Configure the game within Lutris and go to `System options`. Make sure `Show advanced options` is checked. Add the following to the `Pre-launch script` and `Post-exit script` fields:

**Gnome**

`/usr/bin/sh -c "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse accel-profile flat"`

`/usr/bin/sh -c "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse accel-profile default"`

**KDE**

`/usr/bin/sh -c 'kwriteconfig5 --file "kcminputrc" --group "Mouse" --key "XLbInptAccelProfileFlat" true'`

`/usr/bin/sh -c 'kwriteconfig5 --file "kcminputrc" --group "Mouse" --key "XLbInptAccelProfileFlat" false'`
